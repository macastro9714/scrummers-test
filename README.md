Scrummers Test for Front End

## About this page

In this app there will be 3 options to show a list of geometrical figures: a list of image based figures, figures stylized with CSS and figures from a third party library.
The main reason to do it like this is to show how components can be reusable in different scenarios.

## Image List

In this list you can add images that would represent some shape, you can edit them in size and changing the image URL, also you can add or delete items of the list.

## Css List

In this list you can add figures based on CSS style for example you can create a new shape with the style { "width": "150px", "height": "150px", "borderRadius": "50%", "backgroundColor": "#7986cb" } to make a circle.

## External Library List

This list is based on React Shapes library, so you can create and modify shapes according to: https://github.com/rsamec/react-shapes. Currently the implemented types of shapes are Rectangle, Circle, Ellipse, Line and Triangle,
